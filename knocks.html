											<a href="#top"> <i class="button icon solid solo fa-arrow-up"></i></a>
										</div>
								Team Knocksoniacs was formed by like minded students and is completely run by the students under the guidance of faculty from School of 
                                        Mechanical Sciences, IIT Bhubaneswar. We come together to collaborate and work together on designing a vehicle and participate in different
                                        competitions. During my tenure as a member of the team, we have participated in the prestigious BAJA SAE India competition. It is 
                                        a collegiate event where engineering students design, fabricate, and race off-road 
                                        vehicles. A combination of technical innovation with teamwork, propels the participants to push their creations to the limit in dynamic challenges that test 
                                        vehicle performance, durability, and maneuverability. The event acts as a platform where the students can foster their practical engineering skills, problem-solving, and 
                                        collaboration, as teams from various institutions showcase their automotive expertise.
                                    </p>

                                        BAJA SAE India is conducted mainly in three rounds: Preliminary Round, Virtual Round, and Physical Round. Preliminary Round is conducted
                                        online and tests the technical and professional capacity of the teams. Virtual Round includes Static Event and Dynamic Event. Static round 
                                        evaluates Design, Cost and the Sales Presentation. The final Physical round includes Events such as Acceleration Event, Maneuverability 
                                        Event, Suspension & Traction Event & Endurance Event. I was involved in the Brakes &AMP; Suspension department of the team. I also got the 
                                        opportunity to work on Ergonomics of the vehicle and was involved in the simulations of the ATV.

										An open ATV was manufactured, entirely in house, and we have participated in the main event. The engine used in the vehicle, has been an unmodified
                                        Briggs & Stratton Intek 20 single-cylinder with a displacement of 305cc and power output of approximately 10 bhp (7.5 kW). The overall exxperience
                                        of working in the team and getting an opportunity to build the vehicle, has given us invaluable hands on exxperience. I would like to thank
                                        Dr. Pattabhi Ramaiah and Dr. Gaurav Baratarya, from School of Mechanical Sciences, IIT Bhubaneswar for acting as our Faculty Advisors and giving us
                                        the right amount of resources and insights and thereby guiding us forward. 
                                    </p>
